# Simple-Python-UsernamePassword-Code
The requirements:
Write an application that will allow a user to enter their username and password to access the ‘vault’. 
If the username is incorrect a message should appear “Incorrect Username”. If the password is incorrect a message should appear “Incorrect Password”. If both are incorrect then a message appears “Incorrect Username & Password”. If both correct – the vault opens.
Users will only have three attempts of logging in successfully before being locked out. If they are locked out a message will appear “Application Locked – Ring the Network Manager for Assistance”
Python was used to achieve this
